Are you wondering what Machine learning is? Here is an easy and non-technical explanation of the most frequent terms used in Machine learning.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial intelligence is mimicking human intelligence in machines. AI is frequently used interchangeably with ML but artificial intelligence is a broader term.  

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
